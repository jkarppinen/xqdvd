# xqDVD-o-Matic

A simple site for collecting video suggestions for a DVD collection.

## History

At the university, each spring we take an excursion to the city of Tallinn in Estonia.
What'd be a better way to spend your time on the 600 kilometer bus ride than watching terrible youtube videos and having a few beers with your friends? Nothing!
I can see only one problem in this scenario. Not everyone likes to watch adorable kitty videos. Deciding the videos should be a democratic act!

Clearly the community needed a tool. A tool that would make the excursion dvd creation process more tolerable. More democratic. More Fun.

The time was right. I had the knowhow to implement these ambitious plans. I had to do it.



*I did it.*







(For reals, I made this for an assignment for an user interface programming course at the university)

## Installing

Create the database using `install.sql`. Then modify `config.php`. Everything should work.

## Live example

The tool *should* be live at [my website](http://www.mattaku.fi/xqdvd).
